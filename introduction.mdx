### What is RAGNER?

RAGNER is an AI orchestration swarm that transforms your protocol documentation (API, RPC, Contracts, SOAP, GraphQL, etc.) into dynamic, interactive agents. It simplifies **DSL (Domain-Specific Language) integrations** and becomes a callable tool for other AI agents.

These agents act as composable building blocks, capable of executing tasks autonomously while being easily accessible to both developers and non-developers.

  Ragner.ai eliminates friction in developer understanding, integration and
  onboarding for both humans and AI agents.

<Card title="The name R.A.G:NER">
  Is inspired by the AI ecosystem term **R.A.G (Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation)**. It reflects evolution beyond traditional RAG to create
  context-aware, intuitive, and actionable Agents & tools.

#### Key Features

- **Automated Documentation Intelligence**: Effortlessly parses complex data documentations in any formatâ€”from modern OpenAPI specs to legacy XML and PDFs.

- **Instant Tools Generation**: Every API endpoint becomes a powerful, context-aware tool instantly used by developers and AI agents. Say goodbye to wrestling with complex integration processes.

- **Natural Language Interface**: Interact with enterprise APIs using plain English commands. RAGNER translates human instructions into precise API calls.

- **Universal Compatibility**: Works seamlessly across all major programming languages, protocols, and frameworks, including the Web3 and Blockchain ecosystem.

- **Intelligent Workflow Orchestration**: Like building with LEGO blocks, leverage composable swarms to create multi-step workflows by combining multiple Ragnar API Agents without writing code.

### **Who is it For?**

- **Development Teams**: Streamline API integration and reduce manual coding.
- **Enterprises**: Enhance API usability, boost adoption 5X, grow sales, and streamline developer onboarding.
- **AI Builders**: Automate API-to-agent integration. Enable instant agent-to-agent communication without custom code.
- **Blockchain Innovators**: Turn complex contracts instantly usable with tools. Eliminate smartcontract integration barriers.
