### What is RAGNER?

RAGNER is an AI orchestration swarm that transforms your protocol documentation (API, RPC, Contracts, SOAP, GraphQL, etc.) into dynamic, interactive agents. It simplifies **DSL (Domain-Specific Language) integrations** and becomes a callable tool for other AI agents.

These agents act as composable building blocks, capable of executing tasks autonomously while being easily accessible to both developers and non-developers.

<Tip>
  Ragner.ai eliminates friction in developer understanding, integration and
  onboarding for both humans and AI agents.

<Card title="The name R.A.G:NER">
  Is inspired by the AI ecosystem term **R.A.G (Retrieval-Augmented
  Generation)**. It reflects evolution beyond traditional RAG to create
  context-aware, intuitive, and actionable Agents & tools.

### ðŸ”¥ The Ragner Difference

The end of integration debt starts here.

#### 1. Documentation Intelligence

Upload any protocol documentation (APIs, RPCs, GraphQL, Solidity contracts), and Ragner instantly generates:

- **Protocol to Agents:** your API endpoints become callable AI tools.
- **Natural Language Interface:** Interact with enterprise APIs using plain English commands. RAGNER translates human instructions into precise API calls

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Salesforce Execution Example
"Show me real-time sales data from Salesforce API" -> "GET /sales/realtime
```

```python SDK Integration Example:
#   Turn CoinGecko's API documentation into an Agent
from ragner.lothebrook import Agent

defi_agent = Agent.from_docurl("https://docs.coingecko.com/v3.0.1/")
response = defi_agent.query("Whatâ€™s the current APY for Ethereum staking?")
print(response)
# Output: "ETH staking APY is 5.2% via Lido. [Source: CoinGecko, updated 3s ago]"
```

</CodeGroup>

#### 2.Universal Compatibility

Works seamlessly across all major programming languages, protocols, and frameworks, including the Web3 and Blockchain ecosystem.

**From legacy banks to decentralized networks:**

| **Category**   | **Supported Protocols**                       |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Web2**       | REST, SOAP, GraphQL, WebSockets               |
| **Web3**       | Ethereum RPC, Solana, Cosmos, Smart Contracts |
| **Enterprise** | SAP, Salesforce, Oracle DB                    |
| **Legacy**     | XML, MQTT, FTP                                |

#### 3.Intelligent Workflow Orchestration

Like building with LEGO blocks, Powers composable workflows across Web2, Web3, and enterprise stacks

    B --> C[Supplier API Agent]
    B --> D[Salesforce CRM Agent]
    C --> E[Purchase Order Generator]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Auto-Execute via ERP]
```

#### 4.Serverless Deployment

Deploy AI agents without the need for managing servers, ensuring scalability and reduced operational overhead.

### **Who is it For?**

- **Development Teams**: Streamline API integration and reduce manual coding.
- **Enterprises**: Enhance API usability, boost adoption 5X, grow sales, and streamline developer onboarding.
- **AI Builders**: Automate API-to-agent integration. Enable instant agent-to-agent communication without custom code.
- **Blockchain Innovators**: Turn complex contracts instantly usable with tools. Eliminate smartcontract integration barriers.
