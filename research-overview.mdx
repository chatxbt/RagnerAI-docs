### Our Paradigm

We ensure all findings undergo thorough evaluation by domain experts before publication.

For transparency, we also provide access to unreviewed drafts:

- [The Silent Crisis Stifling Innovation: How Agents Will Redefine Human Potential](https://www.notion.so/delta-joe/Ragner-research-paper-17b11138488780e5819dcef9ece918f8)
- Draft 2: coming soon ðŸ‘€

These drafts represent work-in-progress and should be interpreted with caution until peer review is complete.

These documents are open source on github and anyone can contribute to them prior to publication.
