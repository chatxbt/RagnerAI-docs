### Welcome to Ragner's documentation.

The future belongs to autonomous systems that communicate seamlessly. Yet today, developers waste months integrating APIs, while AI agents remain shackled by brittle, manual workflows.

With ragner you can:

1. **API to Agents:** Convert your existing APIs, smart contracts, RPCs, and legacy systems into AI agents capable of executing actions and interacting with users and other agents.
2. **Serverless Deployment:** Deploy AI agents without the need for managing servers, ensuring scalability and reduced operational overhead.
3. **Composable Workflow Orchestration:** Create multi-step workflows by combining multiple Ragnar API Agents without writing code.

## Our Vision

A world where systems communicate as fluidly as neurons in a brain we aim to eliminate **integration friction** between systems and AI agent, where developers build _with_ intelligence, not just _for_ it and enabling everyone including enterprises to automate complex workflows effortlessly.
