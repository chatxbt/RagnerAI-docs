<Note>
  Composable AI lets you build complex AI systems by combining modular
  components, similar to how Legos or Docker containers work.

## What is Composability in AI?

Composability in AI refers to the ability to design and assemble modular AI components that can interact, function independently, and be reconfigured to meet specific use cases.

  <Tab title="Traditional Workflow">
    - Manual API integration for each platform - Complex pipeline setups with
    fragile links - Siloed analytics for each platform - Rebuilding workflows
    for new platforms - Platform takes fees
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="RAGNER Workflow">
    - Reusable API building blocks - Plug-and-play Pipes for ingestion to output
    - Unified analysis through AI Agents - Swap or add Connectors for new
    platforms - Usage Revenue distributed to creators
