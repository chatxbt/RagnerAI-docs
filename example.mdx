## Healthcare Interoperability Hub

### Problem

Healthcare providers struggle with fragmented patient data across multiple EHR systems, leading to delayed care and missed opportunities for preventive treatment.

### Solution

Intelligent agents seamlessly connect and analyze data across:

- Epic EHR systems
- HL7 FHIR interfaces
- Insurance claim platforms

### Workflow

1. Physician initiates: "Identify diabetic patients due for retinal screening"
2. Agents automatically:
   - Parse multiple EHR databases
   - Check insurance coverage
   - Cross-reference lab results
   - Create risk-stratified patient lists

### Impact

50% reduction in care coordination time, leading to faster interventions and better patient outcomes.

## Smart Factory Operations

### Problem

Critical manufacturing data remains trapped between operational technology (OT) and IT systems, causing preventable downtime.

### Solution

Unified agent network connecting:

- Industrial IoT sensors (Modbus TCP)
- Manufacturing systems (OPC UA)
- Enterprise software (SAP ERP)

### Workflow

1. Equipment sensors detect performance anomaly
2. Agents orchestrate response:
   - Generate maintenance work orders
   - Alert engineering team via Slack
   - Check spare parts availability
   - Schedule optimal maintenance window

### Impact

20% reduction in monthly downtime, optimized maintenance scheduling, and improved resource utilization.
